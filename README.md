# relay

Real time processing chain for CanSat telemetry, data collection, streaming and machine learning inference on limited hardware using microservices. Designed to be modular and extensible to allow for easy integration of new services and features following a language agnostic approach and giving the OS the repsonsibility of managing resources and scheduling via `systemd`.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ULAS-HiPR/relay.git
cd relay

# See README.md in each service for more details
```

## Services

Preferably, each service should be written in a compiled language (e.g. Rust, C, C++, etc.) to ensure the best performance and resource usage. However, interpreted languages (e.g. Python, Node.js, etc.) are also acceptable if the service is not computationally intensive or for ML. For example the `health` service is written in Rust to reduce its effect on the health data it is monitoring.

| Service | Description | Language | Details | Status |
| ------- | ----------- | -------- | ------ | ------ |
| health | Device vitals monitoring | Rust | [README](./health/README.md) | [![Health Test](https://github.com/ULAS-HiPR/relay/actions/workflows/health.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/ULAS-HiPR/relay/actions/workflows/health.yml) |

*Note: IPs, ports, MQ server details, etc. are stored in `config.toml` and are loaded into the environment at runtime ([see here](config.toml)).*

## Data

A RabbitMQ server is used to queue data between services. This allows for a decoupled architecture and allows for services to be added and removed without affecting the rest of the system. It also allows for services to be scaled horizontally to increase throughput. It allows for failure in services to be handled gracefully and for services to be restarted without affecting the rest of the system.

It runs locally on the deice (can be exposed to Network IP) for remote debugging and monitoring. It can be used to stream remotely for ground station etc.

## Testing

All services must be suitably **unit tested** to verify correct behaviour and correct exception handling. Make sure to create a **CI pipeline** to run your tests for feature branches. Ensure these are ran on PR and on merge so we can verify a valid system.

### Releasing to target

For compiled languages `scp` the binary over into its correct location (keep in mind we will clone this repo onto target device to ensure paths remain valid especially for configuration. In the case of interpreted languages no action other than calling the interpreter in the service execution step is required.

*Note: for compiled languages, cross compile on your local machine and then push the binary to the target device.*

> `release.sh` - remote push the binary to the target device having cross compiled it

### Orchestration (deployment)

Writing a `.service` file is more straight forward than you'd think. You specificy where the program is, what is running it and when to run it. See `health` for more details.

Example service file: [health.service](./health/health.service)

> `deploy.sh` - informing `systemd` of the new service via registration.
