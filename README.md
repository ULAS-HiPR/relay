# sat-x

A generalised payload software to run data acquisition and telemetry with an extensible system for other experiments. Orchestrated by `systemd` it runs on boot with retries as a system service, communicating over `amqp` queues. The aim of this package is to provide a robust baseline for any CanSat/CubeSat project with minimal onboarding/adaptation time.

WIP!
